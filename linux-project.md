# AUX Project 1: Shell Scripting | Onboarding New Linux Users onto a Server

## Introduction

In this project, 20 new users would be created and onboarded onto a server. Each user is added to an existing group called developers. (The developer group would also be created in this project). The shell script would check the existence of a user before creation and also ensure each user has its own default home folder. Also each user would have a .ssh folder within the home folder and for each user's ssh configurarion, an authorized_key file would be created with the public and private key of the current user.
